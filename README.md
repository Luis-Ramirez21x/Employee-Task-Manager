# Employee-Task Manager

This application will allow small businesses the ability to create employee logins and then assign those employees specific tasks related to their role in the company. The structure for the app is one central “manager” login that can view all employees and their tasks and the rest if the logins are created by the manager as “employee” logins. Employees can view tasks assigned to them and designate whether they have completed them or not.
