Web app where employers can assign tasks to employees and track their progress.

## Description

This is an application designed for employers with multiple employees. Multiple users can be integrated in to the app and both employer and employees can see and monitor their progress on assigned tasks.

The app includes a dashboard where the employer can see graphic representations of the degree of completion of various tasks. The graphics are modifiable based on different categories which can be useful when running reports and comparing employee progress.
